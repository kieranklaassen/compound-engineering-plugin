# Frontend Design Skill

Create distinctive, production-grade frontend interfaces that avoid generic "AI slop" aesthetics.

## What This Skill Does

This skill guides Claude in creating visually striking, memorable frontend interfaces. Instead of generating typical AI-generated designs with predictable patterns, it produces bold, intentional designs with:

- **Distinctive typography** - Characterful fonts that elevate aesthetics
- **Cohesive color schemes** - Dominant colors with sharp accents
- **Purposeful motion** - Impactful animations and micro-interactions
- **Creative layouts** - Asymmetry, overlap, and grid-breaking elements

## Common Workflows

### 1. Creating a Landing Page
Ask Claude to build a landing page with a specific aesthetic direction (brutalist, art deco, minimalist luxury, etc.).

### 2. Designing a Component Library
Generate a set of UI components with a unified design language.

### 3. Building Interactive Widgets
Create widgets with engaging hover states and scroll-triggered animations.

### 4. Prototyping a Web Application
Rapidly prototype app interfaces with production-quality code.

### 5. Redesigning Existing Interfaces
Transform generic designs into distinctive, memorable experiences.
